TODO:

-- MAKE A GRID FOR ENTRY APPOINTING

-- NOTE DIALOG NEEDS 4 TABS

-- ADD ACCOUNT NUMBER TO PATIENT PROFILE INFO

-- PATIENT PROFILE ONLY TO HAVE NOTES List

-- EACH NOTE WILL HAVE THE FOUR TABS OF CATEGORIES

-- ADD A DELETE ICON FEATURE TO NOTE TABLE



COMPLETED:

-- NIX NEXT APPOINTMENT
++ FINISHED

PL1, PL2
-- OPEN/CLOSE NAVIGATION FEATURE
++ FEATURE ALREADY EXISTS, CLICK THE 3 BARS (HAMBURGER MENU)

-- ADD ACCOUNT NUMBER IN SPECIFIC FORMAT TO PATIENT DATA MODEL
++ ACCT NO is now on patient data model

-- MOVE PROFILE SQUARE TO FIXED BOTTOM LEFT OF NAV PANE
++ SIDEBAR IS COLLAPSIBLE AND A STATIC MENU. I DON'T THINK THIS IS VERY PRACTICAL TO KEEP PATIENT INFORMATION IN THE SIDE PANEL AND ADVISE AGAINST, PROFILE WILL ONLY BE IN VIEW WHEN MENU IS OPEN.
++ IF WE STILL WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT, LET ME KNOW.

-- MOVE CERTAIN BUTTONS TO CERTAIN POSITIONS
++ KEEPING BACK BUTTONS AS IS FOR NOW. IT IS BEST PRACTICE TO KEEP THE NAVBAR 'STATIC' ITEMS AND NOT PLACING THINGS IN AND OUT OF THE NAVBAR AND TO KEEP NAVIGATIONAL COMPONENTS WITHIN THE AREA THAT THE CORRESOPNDING COMPONENTS LIVE.
++ IF WE STILL WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS DESIGN, LET ME KNOW

-- DISPLAY ACCOUNT NUMBER 
++ DONE

-- ADD MIDDLE INITIAL TO DATA MODEL, PUSH TO PROD DB, SHOW IN PATIENT FORM
++ FIX
