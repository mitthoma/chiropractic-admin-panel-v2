-- OPEN/CLOSE NAVIGATION FEATURE
++ FEATURE ALREADY EXISTS

-- MOVE CERTAIN BUTTONS TO CERTAIN POSITIONS
++ KEEPING BACK BUTTONS AS IS FOR NOW. IT IS BEST PRACTICE TO KEEP THE NAVBAR 'STATIC' ITEMS AND NOT PLACING THINGS IN AND OUT OF THE NAVBAR AND TO KEEP NAVIGATIONAL COMPONENTS WITHIN THE AREA THAT THE CORRESOPNDING COMPONENTS LIVE.
